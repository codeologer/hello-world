# hello-world
My first repository
Greetings to the people of Earth! I am Specimen Gamma, a Codeologer from Bitabot University. I live in Grungle City, Bitabot, and I am here on my 6,786th visit to Earth. A few things I like about your planet include GitHub, blue skies (ours are orange) and marshmallows.
